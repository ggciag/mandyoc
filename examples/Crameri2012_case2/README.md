# Example: Crameri et al. (2012) - Case 2

The Case 2 experiment presented by Crameri et al. (2012) [1] evaluates the sticky air method
to obtain a numerical surface topography in geodynamic modelling.

The experiment analyses the change in topography due to the rising of a mantle plume.
The model setup consists of a 2800km by 850km box with a 150km sticky air layer on the top of the model.
The mantle thickness is 600km with a 100km thick lithosphere.
The lithosphere density is 3300 kg/m^3 with viscosity 10^23 Pa.s,
the mantle density is 3300 kg/m^3 with viscosity 10^21 Pa.s
and the mantle plume density is 3200 kg/m^3 with viscosity 10^20 Pa.s.

Initially, the center of the plume is horizontally centered and 300 km above the base of the model.
At the top, the sticky air layer has density 0 kg/m^3 with viscosity 10^19 Pa.s.
A free slip boundary condition is applied to the upper boundary of the sticky air layer
and the vertical sides of the model and the base is kept fixed.
There is no temperature difference, and the geodynamic evolution is guided solely by compositional density differences.
